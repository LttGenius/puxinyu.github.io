My name is Xinyu Pu (蒲鑫宇).

I have just graduated from [CEIE](http://ceie.swu.edu.cn/), [Southwest University](www.swu.edu.cn) (China), earning a Bachelor of Information Security. 
I am extremely grateful to [Hangjun Che](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Che-Hangjun) who introduced me to multi-view learning. 


My current research focuses on **Generative Model**, e.g. image editing. 
My previous research interests is **Unsupervised Learning**, e.g. multi-view learning and clustering. 
I have a passion for Artificial Intelligence and wish to propose meaningful works. 

For any problem concerning my work, please feel free to contact me ([Xinyu Pu, SWU](mailto:xndsb330@email.swu.edu.cn), [Xinyu Pu](mailto:pushyu404@163.com)).
