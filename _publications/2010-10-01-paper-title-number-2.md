excerpt: 'This paper is about the robust graph-based multiview clustering. A novel multi-view clustering method referred to as RLGMC is proposed. In this method, we combine spectral embedding, low-rank tensor learning and noise constraints into a unified framework. By learning a robust tensor, the underlying structure implied in multiple views is effectively captured.'
